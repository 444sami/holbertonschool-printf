_printf
.SH SYNOPSIS
int printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function produces output according to a .B format string. The function writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.
.B Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, is composed of ordinary characters and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character % and ends with a conversion .B specifier.
.B Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied:
.B %: 
	A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.B c: 
	The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.B s:
 	the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). 
.B d, i: 
	The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
